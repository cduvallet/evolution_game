1,growth rate,"S, P, T, A","Persistence, bacteria can go into 'dormant' mode",Bacteria that don't have antibiotic resistance but do have this can survive
2,protection,"H, N, Q, V, Y",Antibiotic resistance,Bacteria without this don't survive
3,metabolism,,,All bacteria can survive - there's lots of food in the gut! :D
