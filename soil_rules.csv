Position,Function,Amino acids,Specific function,Fate
1,growth rate,"F, L, I, V","High growth rate, gives bacteria the ability to adapt quickly to new open niches",Bacteria without this don't survive
2,protection,"A, E, D, F, I, L, V",Cell wall anti-phage protein,Bacteria without this don't survive
3,metabolism,"D, E, Y, V, C, S, K, R",Allows the bacteria to eat a very specific nutrient (that other bacteria can't eat),Bacteria that don't have a high growth but do have this can survive
4,oxygen requirement,"T, S, Y, Q, N","Strict anaerobe, bacteria can only survive in no-oxygen conditions",Bacteria with this don't survive
