Position,Function,Amino acids,Specific function,Fate
1,growth rate,"F, I, L, V","low growth rate, bacteria doesn't need a lot of energy to survive",Bacteria without this don't survive
2,protection,,,"This one isn't so important - predators 
are dilute enough that bacteria can escape"
3,metabolism,"F, K, N, P, S, T","broad metabolism, bacteria can eat a wide variety of things",Bacteria without this don't survive
4,oxygen requirement,"F, L, I, M, V, A, P","facultative anaerobe, bacteria can surive in both aerobic and anaerobic environments",Bacteria that don't have broad metabolism but do have this can survive
